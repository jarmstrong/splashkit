 * # SplashKit Audio
 * The SplashKit's audio library allows you to easily load and play music and
 * sound effects within your programs. To get started with audio the first
 * thing you need to do is load a sound effect or music file. You can do this
 * by calling the `load_sound_effect(string name)` function to the
 * `load_music(string name)` function.

/**
 * The `sound_effect` type is used to refer to sound effects that can be
 * played by the SplashKit audio code. Sound effects are:
 *
 *   - loaded with `load_sound_effect`,
 *   - played using `play_sound_effect`,
 *   - and must be released using `delete_sound_effect` (to release a specific
 *     sound effect) or `delete_all_sound_effects` (to release all loaded
 *     sound effects).
 *
 * SplashKit will mix the audio from multiple sound effects, making it
 * possible to play multiple `sound_effect`s, or even to play the one
 * `sound_effect` multiple times.
 *
 * You can check if a `sound_effect` is currently playing using
 * `sound_effect_playing`.
 *
 * To stop a `sound_effect` playing use `stop_sound_effect`. This will stop all
 * instances of this one sound effect from playing.
 *
 * \note Use `music` for background music for your games.
